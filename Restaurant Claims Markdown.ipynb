For the past five years, this fast food chain has experienced incredible growth. To reorganize its legal department, they have hired a new chief legal officer.  \n\n## Customer Question\n\nThe chief legal officer has decided to investigate the existing claims records. They want to come up with a plan for the future. They would like you to answer the following questions to help:\n\n- What are the characteristics of the claims in different locations? \n- How much does the claim amount differ from each claim?\n- What we can learn from comparing active claims and closed claims?\n\n## Dataset\nThe data you will use for this analysis can be downloaded from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/talent-assets.datacamp.com/restuarant_claims.csv).","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"cd695d63-8341-47fc-b798-83ea9ffcff07","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Data Analyst Associate Case Study Submission\n\nUse this template to write up your summary for submission.

Have you made any changes to the data to enable further analysis? Remember to describe what you did for every column in the data. \n\nThe table was renamed to correct a misspelling of 'restaurant'.\n\nHEADERS were reassigned by resorting the data and setting first row to headers.\n\nData types were validated:\n\nLAWSUIT NUMBER was text (as expected).  AREA was in data type text (as expected).\n\nCLAIM START DATE was reformatted (originally DD/MM/YYYY as text) by splitting columns using the '/' delimiter, reordering the columns to align with MM/DD/YYYY format, then merging the columns reinserting the '/' between each. Merged column was then formatted to date data type.\n\nCLOSE DATE was reformatted (originally DD/MM/YYYY as text) by splitting columns using the '/' delimiter, reordering the columns to align with MM/DD/YYYY format, then merging the columns reinserting the '/' between each. Merged column was then formatted to date data type.\n\nCLAIM AMOUNT (originally R$50,000.00 text) was cleaned by first using replace values to remove the R and $ characters leading each number. Then the data type was changed to decimal. Project requirements stated numeric, however, numeric is not a data type available within Power BI. Decimal was elected over Whole Number to eliminate potential rounding issues with any future calculations.\n\nAMOUNT PAID (originally R$50,000.00 text) was cleaned by first using replace values to remove the R and $ characters leading each number. Then the data type was changed to decimal. Project requirements stated numeric, however, numeric is not a data type available within Power BI. Decimal was elected over Whole Number to eliminate potential rounding issues with any future calculations.\n\nCITY SUBSIDIARIES was text with four distinct values (as expected).\n\nCONTRACT TYPE was text, but included unwanted values as null placeholders. These were removed with replace values functionality.\n\nSUPPLIER NAME was text, but included unwanted values as null placeholders. These were removed with replace values functionality.\n\nTYPE OF POSITION was text (as expected).\n___________________\n\nCalculated columns were added for ease of visualizing some exploratory analysis:\n\nLapsed Time = DATEDIFF(restaurant_claims[CLAIM START DATE], restaurant_claims[CLOSE DATE], MONTH)\n\nLapsed Time Open = if(restaurant_claims[Lapsed Time] = 0, datediff(restaurant_claims[CLAIM START DATE], TODAY(), MONTH), BLANK())\n\nPCT Payout = restaurant_claims[AMOUNT PAID] / restaurant_claims[CLAIM AMOUNT]\n\nPredictive Payout = IF(restaurant_claims[CLOSE DATE] = 0, average(restaurant_claims[PCT Payout]) * restaurant_claims[CLAIM AMOUNT], BLANK())\n___________________","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"d1b1a012-1ccb-40e7-a1ad-77b60b256690","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### Data Discovery and Visualization\nDescribe what you found in the analysis and how the visualizations answer the customer questions in the project brief. In your description you should:\n- Include at least two different data visualizations to demonstrate the characteristics of variables\n- Include at least one data visualization to demonstrate the relationship between two or more variables\n- Describe how your analysis has answered the business questions in the project brief\n\n![Claims_Characteristics_EDA_1.jpg](Claims_Characteristics_EDA_1.jpg)\n\nThe overview of the dashboard created in Power BI displays multiple breakdowns of the claims data at a glance. \n\nThis visualization explores claims by position type. Immediately viewable by proportion to the total number of claims, the hover-over tool tip includes a sum of the claim value by position as well. Top positions responsible for claims were Cleaning Assistants (24), Kitchen Assistant (13), and Vigilant (12). Vigilant II (9) may be combined with Vigilant for a total of 21 claims, but further context to those positions is required before including that assumption into any analysis. It is also notable that Labor claims account for 84% of all claims. Tax claims are a relatively small portion of both claim count and total claims in reals (R$).\n\n![Claims_Characteristics_EDA_2.jpg](Claims_Characteristics_EDA_2.jpg)\n\nClaims data by City is visualized in the following Tree chart, visual proportions represent total reals (R$) in claims split by Area (Labor and Tax). Tool tip includes counts of claims. Significant variance is noted when slicing by year. Not all City Subsidiaries were in operation in each year of the data captured. CLaims by City Subsidiary are relatively similar in count, but the average claim amount in Fortaleza is significantly less than other City Subsidiaries.\n\nNatal is responsible for 48% of all claims over 200k, while having fewer open claims than other cities. Reorganization may favor personnel who excel in lower-volume, higher-dollar (R$) claims.\n\n![Claims_Characteristics_EDA_3.jpg](Claims_Characteristics_EDA_3.jpg)\n\nExploring claims over time in a drill-down line chart reveals a significant increase in number of claims from 2017 forward. \n\n![Claims_Characteristics_EDA _4.jpg](Claims_Characteristics_EDA _4.jpg)\n\nSlicers were added to narrow visibility by City Subsidiary and/or Date Range. Summary statistics were also provided on a Card visualization for ease of reference and comparison to other more specified visualizations.\n\n![Claims_Characteristics_Slicers_and_Summary_Card.jpg](Claims_Characteristics_Slicers_and_Summary_Card.jpg)\n\nComparing open claims to closed claims provides significant insight regarding the differences between claim amounts and amounts paid. While only 14% of claims are closed, the data provides some support for an approximate payout rate of 47.98%. Using the current payout rate, a ballpark estimate has been provided (claim amount * current payout rate). This is visualized in the purple bar of the Open vs Closed Claims chart. Predictive analysis may provide value in forecasting future payouts on open claims. The data also shows a significant difference between closure of claims with Natal (19%) and Fortaleza (23%), while Recife (12%) and Sao Luis (7%) close significantly fewer claims. Recife and Sao Luis may benefit from additional personnel to increase closure of claims. Payout rates may also influence reorganization strategy.\n\nSao Luis has the greatest number of open claims (28) and may benefit from personnel with higher closure rates or who manage volume of claims with greater efficiency.\n\n![Open_v_Closed_Claims_1.jpg](Open_v_Closed_Claims_1.jpg)\n\nA Payout Gauge provides at-a-glance visualization of the total paid on claims measured against the original amount of those claims. Payout on claims is a typical KPI of legal services. Payout rates may be useful in reorganization strategy, specifically in reassignment of best performance to high-dollar (R$) claims.\n\n![Open_v_Closed_Claims_2.jpg](Open_v_Closed_Claims_2.jpg)\n\nSummary statistics were also included for quick reference comparison of open claims to closed claims.\n\n![Open_v_Closed_Claims_3.jpg](Open_v_Closed_Claims_3.jpg)","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"714a7083-7a43-4b0b-8ed4-2675efc87691","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### âœ… When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric, have you included everything that will be graded?\n-  Head back to the [Certification Dashboard](https://app.datacamp.com/certification) to submit your case study","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"f635131a-00f8-44dd-b610-509db41c1154","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
